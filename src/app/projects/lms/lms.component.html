<p>
  The primary goal of a Learning Management System (LMS) is to enhance users' technical skills
  through structured, accessible, and trackable online learning. Users are assigned a set of
  courses—potentially multiple at a time—each with a defined due date.
</p>
<p>
  They are expected to complete the learning material within the given timeframe and subsequently
  take an assessment to demonstrate their understanding. Upon successfully passing the test, users
  are awarded a certificate of completion, which serves as formal recognition of their achievement.
</p>
<p>
  This process not only helps individuals strengthen their professional capabilities but also
  enables administrators to monitor and evaluate progress effectively. With built-in tracking
  features, the LMS provides clear insights into each user's course completion status, test
  performance, and certification history.
</p>
<p>
  This system supports continuous learning and development while promoting accountability and goal
  setting among users. It is an efficient solution for organizations seeking to upskill their
  workforce and maintain a culture of ongoing learning.
