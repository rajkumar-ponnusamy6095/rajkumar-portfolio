<p>
  Health Information Exchange (HIE) 3.0 is designed with the primary goal of aggregating,
  standardizing, and sharing patient data across the entire health and care ecosystem. By enabling
  seamless access to comprehensive patient information, it empowers healthcare professionals to
  deliver safer, more efficient, and more personalized care.
</p>
<p>
  HIE 3.0 minimizes gaps and errors in patient histories by ensuring all relevant clinical
  data—regardless of where it was generated—is available in one unified view. This comprehensive
  data accessibility reduces unnecessary duplication of diagnostic procedures, such as radiographs
  and laboratory tests, by making previous results visible across all connected healthcare
  facilities.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, HIE 3.0 plays a critical role during inpatient assessments, helping clinicians make
  informed decisions faster. It facilitates more efficient discharge planning by offering insights
  into a patient's broader medical and social care needs, allowing providers to coordinate
  appropriate post-discharge support. Ultimately, HIE 3.0 enhances clinical workflows and
  contributes to better patient outcomes.
