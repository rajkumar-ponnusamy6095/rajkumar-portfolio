  <p>
    Experienced Full Stack Developer with over 8+ years of expertise building scalable,
    high-performance web and hybrid mobile applications. Skilled in Angular, JavaScript (ES6+),
    TypeScript, and modern front-end technologies. Passionate about writing clean, maintainable code
    and delivering impactful solutions in fast-paced Agile environments.
  </p>
  <p class="bullet-p">
    With over eight years of comprehensive experience as a Senior Software Engineer and Full Stack
    Developer, I have cultivated a strong specialization in front-end technologies while maintaining
    a holistic understanding of the entire software development lifecycle. My professional journey
    has been marked by a consistent commitment to building scalable, high-performance web and hybrid
    mobile applications that deliver seamless and engaging user experiences.
  </p>

  <p class="bullet-p">
    My expertise lies in architecting and developing enterprise-grade, responsive applications
    primarily leveraging modern frameworks and technologies such as Angular, JavaScript (ES6+), and
    CSS3. I possess a deep understanding of front-end development principles, UI/UX best practices,
    and cross-platform compatibility, enabling me to create intuitive interfaces that function
    flawlessly across devices and screen sizes. This user-centric approach, combined with rigorous
    attention to code quality and maintainability, ensures that the solutions I deliver are both
    robust and adaptable to evolving business needs.
  </p>

  <p class="bullet-p">
    Over the course of my career, I have had the privilege of working extensively within fast-paced,
    Agile environments, predominantly serving clients in the financial services and healthcare
    sectors. These domains demand high reliability, security, and compliance standards, which have
    sharpened my ability to produce resilient software solutions that meet stringent industry
    requirements. I am well-versed in Agile methodologies, actively engaging in sprint planning,
    daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and collaborative code reviews, thereby fostering continuous
    improvement and knowledge sharing within the teams I have been part of.
  </p>

  <p class="bullet-p">
    A critical aspect of my role involves managing the end-to-end software delivery pipeline. I
    bring substantial experience in configuring and maintaining Continuous Integration and
    Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows utilizing industry-standard tools such as Jenkins,
    GitHub Actions, and UDeploy. These practices have been instrumental in accelerating release
    cycles, enhancing deployment reliability, and reducing downtime. Complementing this, I have
    hands-on expertise with containerization and orchestration technologies including Docker and
    Kubernetes, which enable consistent environment replication and scalable application deployments
    across cloud and on-premises infrastructures.
  </p>

  <p class="bullet-p">
    Beyond technical execution, I have demonstrated leadership through mentoring and coaching junior
    developers, contributing to a culture of collaboration, innovation, and professional growth. I
    prioritize clear communication, constructive feedback, and fostering an inclusive environment
    that empowers team members to reach their full potential. This commitment extends to knowledge
    sharing initiatives and technical documentation, ensuring that the teams I support have access
    to the best practices and lessons learned.
  </p>

  <p class="bullet-p">
    My background also encompasses backend integration and cloud infrastructure management,
    equipping me with a well-rounded skill set to contribute effectively across multiple layers of
    the technology stack. This cross-functional expertise facilitates smoother coordination between
    frontend development and backend services, resulting in cohesive and optimized system
    architectures.
  </p>

  <p class="bullet-p">
    Driven by a passion for innovation and continuous improvement, I actively explore emerging
    technologies and industry trends to identify opportunities for enhancing application
    performance, security, and user satisfaction. Whether it involves refactoring legacy codebases,
    implementing advanced design patterns, or adopting cutting-edge tools, my goal is to
    consistently elevate the quality and value of software solutions delivered.
  </p>

  <p class="bullet-p">
    In summary, I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments where agility, problem-solving, and
    technical excellence are paramount. My career to date reflects a strong track record of
    delivering high-quality, scalable applications that meet complex business requirements while
    fostering team growth and operational efficiency. I am eager to continue leveraging my skills
    and experience to drive impactful software development initiatives and contribute meaningfully
    to organizational success.
